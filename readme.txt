Requirements Document for Anti-Memory Leak Tool
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the Anti-Memory Leak Tool, a Python-based utility designed to monitor and prevent memory leaks in specific processes. The tool ensures that processes do not consume excessive system resources by terminating them if they exceed a predefined memory limit.

1. Purpose
The Anti-Memory Leak Tool is designed to:

Monitor the memory usage of a specific process.

Terminate the process if its memory usage exceeds a configurable limit.

Provide a lightweight, cross-platform solution for managing memory leaks in long-running processes.

2. Scope
The tool will:

Be implemented in Python.

Use the psutil library for process and memory monitoring.

Read configuration from a JSON file (config.json).

Run continuously, checking memory usage at regular intervals.

Terminate processes that exceed the specified memory limit.

3. Functional Requirements
3.1 Configuration Management
FR-1: The tool shall read configuration settings from a JSON file (config.json).

Configuration keys:

process_name: Name of the process to monitor (e.g., "my_app.exe").

memory_limit_mb: Memory limit in megabytes (MB) (e.g., 1024 for 1 GB).

check_interval: Time interval (in seconds) between memory checks (default: 5 seconds).

3.2 Process Monitoring
FR-2: The tool shall identify all running processes with the specified name.

FR-3: The tool shall monitor the memory usage of the identified processes.

FR-4: The tool shall log the memory usage of the monitored processes to the console.

3.3 Memory Limit Enforcement
FR-5: The tool shall compare the memory usage of each process against the configured memory limit.

FR-6: If a process exceeds the memory limit, the tool shall terminate the process and log the action.

3.4 Error Handling
FR-7: The tool shall handle missing or invalid configuration files gracefully.

Display an error message if the configuration file is missing or contains invalid JSON.

FR-8: The tool shall handle cases where the specified process is not found.

Log a message indicating that no matching processes were found.

FR-9: The tool shall handle cases where a process terminates unexpectedly during monitoring.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Performance
NFR-1: The tool shall perform memory checks with minimal impact on system performance.

NFR-2: The tool shall support monitoring multiple processes simultaneously without significant performance degradation.

4.2 Usability
NFR-3: The tool shall provide clear and concise console output for monitoring and termination events.

NFR-4: The tool shall be easy to configure via a JSON file.

4.3 Reliability
NFR-5: The tool shall run continuously without crashing, even if monitored processes terminate unexpectedly.

NFR-6: The tool shall handle edge cases, such as missing processes or invalid memory values, gracefully.

4.4 Platform Compatibility
NFR-7: The tool shall be compatible with all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) supported by the psutil library.

5. Technical Requirements
5.1 Programming Language
Python 3.x

5.2 Dependencies
psutil library (for process and memory monitoring).

5.3 Configuration
Configuration shall be stored in a JSON file (config.json).

5.4 Logging
Logging shall be done via console output.

6. Assumptions and Constraints
The tool assumes that the process name provided in the configuration file is unique and matches the exact name of the target process.

The tool assumes that the system has sufficient resources to run the monitoring script.

The tool does not support monitoring processes by PID; it only supports monitoring by process name.

7. Future Enhancements
Add support for monitoring processes by PID.

Add support for sending alerts (e.g., email or Slack notifications) when a process is terminated.

Add support for logging to a file instead of just console output.

Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for configuration and monitoring.

8. Dependencies
Python 3.x

psutil library (pip install psutil)

9. Risks
Risk-1: The tool may terminate critical processes if the process name is not specified correctly.

Mitigation: Ensure the process name in the configuration file is accurate.

Risk-2: The tool may not work as expected on systems with restricted permissions.

Mitigation: Run the tool with appropriate administrative privileges.
